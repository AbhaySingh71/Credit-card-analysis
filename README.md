Introduction
Credit card companies collect vast amounts of data on customer transactions, spending patterns, and repayment behaviors. Analyzing this data can provide valuable insights into customer segmentation, fraud detection, credit risk assessment, and marketing strategies.

Data Source
The data for this analysis was obtained from a fictional credit card company. It includes various attributes such as:
Customer ID
Transaction Date
Transaction Amount
Merchant Category
Payment Status
Credit Limit
Balance
Customer Demographics


Data Preparation
Data Cleaning:

Removed duplicate entries
Handled missing values
Corrected inconsistencies in data formats
Data Transformation:

Created new calculated fields (e.g., monthly spending, average transaction amount)
Aggregated data for different time periods (daily, monthly, yearly)
Data Integration:

Merged data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view
Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes several interactive visualizations and reports:

Overview:

Key metrics (total transactions, total spend, average transaction amount)
Customer segmentation based on spending behavior
Trends Analysis:

Monthly and yearly spending trends
Seasonal variations in spending
Category Analysis:

Breakdown of spending by merchant category
Top merchants by transaction volume
Customer Insights:

Demographic analysis (age, gender, income level)
High-value customers and their spending patterns
Credit Risk Assessment:

Analysis of payment behaviors and overdue payments
Identification of high-risk customers
Insights
Spending Trends:

Significant increase in spending during holiday seasons
Consistent monthly spending patterns for most customers
Customer Segmentation:

High-value customers tend to have higher credit limits and spend more in luxury categories
Younger customers prefer online shopping and entertainment categories
Risk Assessment:

A small percentage of customers have a high rate of overdue payments, indicating potential credit risk
Implementing stricter credit limit policies for high-risk customers can reduce default rates
Conclusion
The analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and spending patterns. It highlighted key areas where the credit card company can focus on to improve customer satisfaction, reduce credit risk, and enhance marketing strategies.

Future Work
Incorporate more data sources for a holistic view (e.g., social media data, customer feedback)
Implement machine learning models for predictive analytics (e.g., predicting default risk, identifying fraud)
Continuous monitoring and updating of the dashboard to reflect real-time data
